The technology used is React.js. I have implemented the following features in the calculator :- 
1) Add(+) :- Just add the given two numbers.
2) Multiply(X) :- Just multiply the given two numbers.
3) Subtract(-) :- Just subtract the given two numbers.
4) Divide(/) :- Just divide the given two numbers.
5) Clear(C) :- Just clears the number and set it to zero.
6) Percentage(%) :- Calculates the percentage of the number.
7) Equals(=) :- We use this button when we perform any of the above calculation.
8) Add/subtract(+/-) :- By this feature, we can put negative or positive sign before the number.
